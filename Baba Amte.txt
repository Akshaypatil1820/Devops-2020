 social worker Murlidhar Devidas Amte.Popularly he is known as baba Amte. He was a professional lawyer. He sacrificed his whole life 
 for people who suffered from leprosy.Leprosy is an infectious disease that mainly affects the skin and peripheral nerves. Baba Amte 
 and his wife Sadhna Amte founded Anandwan, an ashram dedicated to the treatment, rehabilitation, and empowerment of leprosy patients. 
 In the 90s due to the lack of education and superstition, Anandwan faced so many difficulties.
		At that time Baba Amte is the only one who stood in between Anandwan and Our Society. Baba Amte was Awarded by Padm Shri,
 Padam Vibhushan, United nations prize in the field of human rights, and many more. Thank you.
